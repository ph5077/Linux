Some shell variables have a corresponding environment variable.
Setting one member of the pair implicitly sets the other. 

For instance, you can use either of the following commands to specify your terminal type:

set term = vt100                This also sets the TERM environment variable
setenv TERM vt100               This also sets the term shell variable

path and PATH are another such pair, although their values are specified using different formats:

set path = (Ëœ/bin /usr/bin /bin /usr/ucb)
setenv PATH /usr/staff/dubois/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/ucb
