.cshrc：Command must be run for each shell that starts up
.login: Commands to be run only at login

Examples of .login

  1. Terminal settings, like tset, reset, and stty.
  2. set environment variables. 
    (Non-login shells inherit environment variables from the login shell
    to set those variables only once, using .login, not .cshrc.)
  3. Commands like biff, which controls the announcement of new mail, or mesg
    which determines whether other users can write to your terminal.
  4. Commands show info at login time 
      uptime：to find out how busy the system
      msgs –q：to see if there are new system messages
      who：to see who else is logged in
      date：to display the current date and time.
